// RouteHandlers.js

// A sample handler for GET requests
exports.myRouteHandler = (req, res) => {
  // Handle the incoming request and send a response
  res.send('Response from myRouteHandler');
};

// You can export more handlers for different routes
exports.anotherRouteHandler = (req, res) => {
  // Handle a different route
  res.send('Response from anotherRouteHandler');
};

// Continue to add as many handlers as needed for your routes
